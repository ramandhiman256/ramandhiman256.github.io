My doctoral research lies at the intersection of membrane science, biophysics, and neuromorphic computing.</p> <p>I initially worked on the development of biomimetic membranes using engineered outer membrane proteins for separation applications. Exposure to neuroscience through coursework developed my strong interest in the role of biological membrane proteins in learning and memory in the brain. This perspective now informs my current research, where I focus on developing bio-membrane–based memristive materials for physical neuromorphic and reservoir computing architectures.</p> <p>I completed my undergraduate studies in Chemical Engineering at IIT Gandhinagar, where I was awarded the Institute Silver Medal for academic excellence. In addition to my academic training, I have two years of combined experience in industrial and academic research environments, which has strengthened my ability to translate fundamental research into applied technologies.</p> </body></html>
