I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in the McKetta Department of Chemical Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin, co-advised by Dr. Manish Kumar and Dr. Benny Freeman. My doctoral research lies at the intersection of membrane science, biophysics, and neuromorphic computing.

I initially worked on the development of biomimetic membranes using engineered outer membrane proteins for separation applications. Exposure to neuroscience through coursework developed my strong interest in the role of biological membrane proteins in learning and memory in the brain. This perspective now informs my current research, where I focus on developing bio-membrane–based memristive materials for physical neuromorphic and reservoir computing architectures.

I completed my undergraduate studies in Chemical Engineering at IIT Gandhinagar, where I was awarded the Institute Silver Medal for academic excellence. In addition to my academic training, I have two years of combined experience in industrial and academic research environments, which has strengthened my ability to translate fundamental research into applied technologies.

. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
